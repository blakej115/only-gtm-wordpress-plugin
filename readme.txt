**Google Tag Manager**

This plugin uses Google Tag Manager to manage and deploy marketing and analytics tags (such as tracking and analytics scripts) across your website. 

- **What it is used for:** Google Tag Manager helps in managing JavaScript and HTML tags used for tracking and analytics without having to modify the code after deployment.
- **What data is sent and when:** 
  - The plugin sends data to Google Tag Manager servers whenever a page or post is loaded on your site. 
  - This includes:
    - **Page URL**: To identify which page is being viewed.
    - **User interactions**: Clicks, form submissions, or other events if set up in the Tag Manager.
    - **Client ID**: A unique identifier for tracking user sessions.
  - Data is sent automatically each time a page loads where the GTM script is included.
- **Links to terms of service and privacy policy:**
  - [Google Tag Manager Terms of Service](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/)
  - [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

By using Google Tag Manager, you are also agreeing to allow Google to process data about your site visitors according to their privacy policies. Users should be aware that this might involve data collection across multiple websites for ad personalization, analytics, and other services provided by Google.
